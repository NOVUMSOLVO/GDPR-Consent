# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

This GDPR Consent Management System implements enterprise-grade security measures to protect sensitive healthcare data and ensure GDPR compliance. This document outlines our security practices and guidelines for secure usage.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Secure token-based authentication with configurable expiration
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin-only access to sensitive operations
- **Session Management**: Automatic session timeout and token validation
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt for password storage

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted in database storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Data Anonymization**: Automated anonymization for expired consent records
- **Secure Headers**: Helmet.js for security headers implementation

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Server-side Validation**: Joi schema validation for all inputs
- **Client-side Validation**: Zod schema validation with React Hook Form
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: TypeORM parameterized queries
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input sanitization

### Rate Limiting & DDoS Protection
- **API Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits for sensitive endpoints
- **Authentication Rate Limiting**: Enhanced protection for login endpoints
- **Request Size Limits**: Body parser limits to prevent large payload attacks

## üö® Protected Business Knowledge

### Confidential Components

The following components contain proprietary business logic and must be protected:

#### Core Business Algorithms
- **Consent Validation Engine**: Proprietary algorithms for validating consent preferences
- **Data Retention Logic**: Custom strategies for data lifecycle management
- **Audit Trail Generation**: Specialized logging and compliance reporting mechanisms
- **Healthcare Workflow Patterns**: Industry-specific consent management workflows

#### Security Implementations
- **Custom Authentication Flows**: Proprietary session management and token handling
- **Encryption Strategies**: Custom encryption patterns for healthcare data
- **Compliance Automation**: Automated GDPR compliance checking and reporting
- **Risk Assessment Algorithms**: Proprietary risk scoring for consent decisions

#### Database Schemas & Relationships
- **Entity Relationships**: Optimized database design for healthcare compliance
- **Indexing Strategies**: Performance-optimized database indexing
- **Migration Patterns**: Custom database migration and versioning strategies

### Access Restrictions

1. **Source Code Access**: Limited to authorized personnel only
2. **Database Access**: Restricted to admin users with audit logging
3. **Configuration Files**: Environment variables and secrets management
4. **API Documentation**: Internal API documentation is confidential
5. **Business Logic**: Algorithms and workflows are trade secrets

## üîê Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required Security Variables:**
```bash
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-256-bit-secret-key
JWT_EXPIRY=30m

# Database Security
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
DATABASE_SSL=true

# CORS Configuration
CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-trusted-domain.com

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000  # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100

# Security Headers
HELMET_CSP_ENABLED=true
HELMET_HSTS_ENABLED=true
```

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins
- [ ] Set up database SSL connections
- [ ] Enable audit logging for all sensitive operations
- [ ] Configure rate limiting for production traffic
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting for security events
- [ ] Regular security updates and dependency scanning
- [ ] Implement backup and disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Configure firewall rules and network security

## üö® Vulnerability Reporting

### Responsible Disclosure

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure:

1. **DO NOT** create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO NOT** share vulnerability details publicly before resolution
3. **DO** email security concerns to: security@novumsolvo.com
4. **DO** provide detailed information about the vulnerability
5. **DO** allow reasonable time for investigation and resolution
