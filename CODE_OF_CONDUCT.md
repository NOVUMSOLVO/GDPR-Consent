## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Investigation Process

1. **Initial Review**: All reports will be acknowledged within 24 hours
2. **Investigation**: Thorough investigation of the reported incident
3. **Decision**: Determination of appropriate response based on findings
4. **Action**: Implementation of corrective measures if necessary
5. **Follow-up**: Monitoring to ensure resolution and prevent recurrence

### Confidentiality

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Details of the incident will be kept confidential and shared only with those necessary for investigation and resolution.

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. This includes serious confidentiality or security breaches.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
